# STU-Counseling-Bookmarks
A simple bookmark app for students at the Seoul Theological Seminary

Although small, this is my first published work! I created this bookmark page for my father, 
who is the dean of the Department of Counseling at Seoul Theological Seminary. 
The student body was in need of a centralized space that collectively provided all the necessary links for quick access, 
so I decided a simple static page with a compiled list of links (populating the actual page in the designated iframe) would suffice.
